This program will display nine different units of conversion, ask the user to choose a unit to convert from, a unit to convert to, will take the unit measurement from 
the user, and provide a converstion for the user base on the options that were choosen. This program utilizes the "units.txt" file a as dictionary with unit 
conversions store in CSV format. The program opens and reads the selected items to convert from and to and provides the result as a float.
